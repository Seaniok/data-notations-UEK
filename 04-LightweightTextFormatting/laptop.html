    <h2 id="definition-of-a-laptop">Definition of a laptop</h2>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop">laptop</a> computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop
        or
        notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC).</p>
    <p>Laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work (especially on business trips), in education, for
        playing
        games, content creating, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.</p>
    <h2 id="types-of-laptop">Types of laptop</h2>
    <h4 id="smaller-and-larger-laptops">Smaller and larger laptops</h4>
    <p>There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included
        &quot;notebook&quot; and &quot;subnotebook&quot; models, low cost &quot;netbooks&quot;, and &quot;ultra-mobile
        PCs&quot; where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphone and handheld tablets, and &quot;Desktop
        replacement&quot; laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful
        processors
        or graphics hardware.</p>
    <h4 id="convertible-hybrid-2-in-1">Convertible, hybrid, 2-in-1</h4>
    <p>Convertibles are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be
        flipped,
        rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. Hybrids have a
        keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with
        the
        display.</p>
    <h4 id="rugged-laptop">Rugged laptop</h4>
    <p>A rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme
        temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than
        regular laptops,and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.</p>
    <h2 id="laptop-hardware">Laptop hardware</h2>
    <p>The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were
        miniaturized and adapted to mobile use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the
        maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has
        increasingly narrowed.</p>
    <p>In general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable by the end-user, except for
        components
        that can be detached; in the past, batteries and optical drives were commonly exchangeable. In the past, many
        laptops featured socketed processors but as of 2025 virtually all laptops use processors that are soldered to
        the
        motherboard. Many laptops come with RAM that is soldered to the motherboard and cannot be easily replaced.</p>
